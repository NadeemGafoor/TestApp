1.Programme Operator. The IHG® Dining Rewards programme (the “Programme”) is operated by InterContinental Hotels Group (Asia Pacific) Pte Ltd, except in mainland China, where it is operated by IHG Shanghai Ltd, both of which are InterContinental Hotels Group companies (collectively “IHG”). The rights and obligations of IHG under the Programme may be assigned or transferred by IHG to any other related or unrelated entity at any time, and performance thereafter shall be the responsibility of that entity.
2.Programme Benefits. The Programme is designed to give Members access to incremental room and dining benefits to use in participating IHG hotels (“Participating Hotels”) for a fixed annual membership fee subject to the Programme’s terms and conditions. Unless otherwise noted, these benefits apply only at Participating Hotels with Participating Brands, as defined below.
3.Membership Card. A membership card of the IHG® Dining Rewards Programme (the “Membership Card”) will be issued to new Members of the Programme. Use of the Membership Card or any of the other Programme benefits constitutes acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. New Membership Cards may be issued from time to time, and the old membership cards will thereafter no longer be accepted for Programme benefits.
4.Participating Brands and Hotels. IHG Hotel brands currently participating in the Programme include InterContinental®, Crowne Plaza®, Hotel Indigo®, Holiday Inn®, and Holiday Inn Resort®. Brands may be added or deleted, at any time and without notice, at the sole discretion of IHG. A “Participating Hotel” is defined as an IHG hotel that has agreed in writing to accept, honour and recognise the Programme membership cards and the benefits that come with the card as outlined below, for a specified time period. Participating Hotels may be added or deleted from the Programme, at any time and without notice, at IHG’s sole discretion. The list of currently Participating Hotels is available on the Programme website, www.ihg.com/diningrewards  .
5.IHG® Rewards Club. As an IHG® Rewards Club member, you may also purchase membership in the Programme (the “Membership”). All Members of the Programme are also automatically members of IHG® Rewards Club, and therefore subject to all IHG® Rewards Club Membership Terms and Conditions. In the event of a perceived conflict between the IHG® Rewards Club Membership Terms and Conditions and the Programme Membership Terms and Conditions, interpretation shall be at the sole discretion of IHG.
6.Membership Fee and Term. Membership in the Programme is available to all individuals for a period of one year from the date of issue of the Membership Card or renewal of the Membership (as the case may be), subject to promotional extensions as specifically noted at the time of purchase, upon payment of the annual membership fee, which may vary by market, country, or region and is available on the Programme website www.ihg.com/diningrewards  .
7.Age Requirement. Members must be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction of their residence, whichever is older.
8.Not Transferable. Programme membership and benefits are not transferable unless stated otherwise. Any deliberate attempts to allow other individuals to utilize the member’s Programme benefits without the member being present may be considered misconduct and are subject to the Member Misconduct terms described below.
9.Specific Country. While most benefits of the Programme apply at all Participating Hotels across multiple countries (unless otherwise noted), the member must purchase a country-specific version of the Programme based on the member's current country of residence and shall pay the specific annual membership fee that applies to that country. Based on the rules and regulations of that country, the membership fee may or not be subject to additional sales taxes or other local taxes. The member must provide a mailing address (to which their membership card and kit will be sent), and if applicable, a billing address, in that specific country.
10.Elite Status. Upon purchase of the Programme: 1) IHG® Rewards Club members at the Club level will be automatically upgraded to Gold Elite; 2) IHG® Rewards Club Gold Elite members will be automatically upgraded to Platinum Elite; and 3) IHG® Rewards Club Platinum Elite members will maintain Platinum Elite status, and will not be eligible for an automatic upgrade to Spire Elite status as a result of their purchase. A non-IHG® Rewards Club member who purchases the Programme will automatically be enrolled in IHG® Rewards Club and be upgraded to Gold Elite.
11.Renewal of Membership. Programme members will be invited to renew their membership every year. In order to continue receiving Programme benefits, members must pay a Programme renewal fee every year prior to membership expiration. If Programme Membership is not timely renewed, then at the end of that calendar year, the upgraded IHG® Rewards Club Elite Status will revert to the status that the member has achieved, based solely on the IHG® Rewards Club Membership Terms and Conditions. The member will continue earning points when staying in participating IHG® hotels worldwide and enjoying the benefits of membership in IHG® Rewards Club.
12.Cancellation of Purchase and Termination of Membership. Members may cancel their purchase of membership in the Programme by contacting the IHG® Dining Rewards Service Centre within twenty-one (21) days of initial purchase, or where required by law within twenty-one (21) days of membership renewal. Please click here   for appropriate contact numbers. Cancellation will only be accepted and a refund provided if the member has not utilised any of the member’s single-use benefits, including the Free Night eCertificate, the 25% Off Best Flexible Rate Certificate, and the Dining e-voucher. No refund of any portion of the annual fee is permitted for any other form of termination of Membership. A member may cancel or terminate Membership in the Programme at any time without terminating membership in IHG® Rewards Club. Following cancellation or termination of Programme Membership, the upgraded IHG® Rewards Club membership status will revert to the membership status that the member has achieved, based solely on the IHG® Rewards Club Membership Terms and Conditions.
13.Member Misconduct. IHG reserves the right to cancel any Programme membership, revoke any and all unredeemed benefits, and retain all membership fees for reasons that include, but are not limited to: 1) violation of these Terms and Conditions; 2) misrepresentation of any information or any misuse of this Programme; 3) violation of any national, regional or local law or regulation in connection with the use of Membership privileges; 4) failure to pay for hotel or restaurant charges; 5) a cheque to a Participating Hotel that is returned for insufficient funds or is invalid for any reason; 6) commission of fraud or abuse involving any portion of this Programme, including any deliberate attempts to allow other individuals to utilize the member’s Programme benefits without the member being present; 7) more than one active IHG® Rewards Club account per member; or 8) physical, verbal, or written abuse of hotel or IHG personnel; 9) termination of Member’s IHG® Rewards Club membership for any reason; or 10) action, in any other way, to the detriment of the Programme or any of its alliances; all as may be determined by IHG in its sole discretion.
14.Lost Cards and Certificates. Please promptly report lost or stolen Cards to the IHG® Dining Rewards Service Centre. If the 25% Off Best Flexible Rate certificate is lost or stolen, it cannot be replaced.
15.Programme Changes and Termination. IHG reserves the right to restrict, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Programme and/or to change, limit, modify or cancel these Membership Terms and Conditions and/or the Programme benefits, conditions of participation, Participating Hotels and restaurant listings in whole or in part at any time with immediate effect by notice posted on the Programme website. A Programme termination notice will be sent and notices of changes in the Programme may periodically be sent as a courtesy, to the last known email address of all currently enrolled Members. Members will be bound by any such changes or termination.
16.Member Profile. Member is responsible for keeping member’s profile information up-to-date in the Programme and IHG® Rewards Club systems, including relevant contact information, such as mailing address and email address. Personal information and communication preferences can be updated at www.ihg.com/diningrewards   or by contacting the IHG® Dining Rewards Service Centre by clicking here  .
