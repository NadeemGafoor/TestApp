Failure to supply the adequate  documentation may result in the denial of such <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Spend. Jumeirah reserves the right to decline any  retrospective <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Spend  requests.</li>
    <li>From the date on which a hotel, resort, outlet or any  other type of partner ceases to be a part of the Jumeirah group of companies,  all visits subsequent to such date will not be eligible to earn <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Spend or use any <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Rewards and no  retroactive claims will be accepted relating to such visits.</li>
    <li><em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Spend cannot be transferred to any  other Member&rsquo;s account.</li>
    <li><em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Spend cannot be registered for  spend that occurred before a Member&rsquo;s enrolment into the programme. <strong></strong></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>3.<em> isme by Jumeirah </em>and Jumeirah Sirius</strong></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Existing Jumeirah Sirius members can join <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> at any time, by  registering their Jumeirah Sirius membership number into the <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> app.</li>
    <li>Jumeirah Sirius<em> and isme by</em> <em>Jumeirah</em> are two  separate programmes with clearly different purposes. Jumeirah Sirius members  can collect and exchange Sirius Points redeemable&nbsp;across the range of  Jumeirah properties globally. <em>isme by  Jumeirah</em> distinguishes itself from Jumeirah Sirius by solely focusing on  dining and lifestyle loyalty rewards in the United Arab Emirates. </li>
    <li><em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Rewards and Jumeirah Sirius Rewards  cannot be used simultaneously. </li>
    <li>It is more advantageous for Members to be a part of  both programmes, since they are complementary. It is very beneficial for Sirius  members to use their <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> App as they will still be able to collect their Jumeirah Sirius Points, but  also increase their <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> spend, thereby getting closer to their next spend rewards in each programme.</li>
    <li><em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Members can collect Sirius points in  any of the participating venues by presenting their isme App where their Sirius  membership number must be saved. Points may take up to 48 hours to appear on  their Sirius account statement. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Members may not increase their <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> spend on hotel stays. Only eligible spend at  participating Jumeirah restaurants, Talise Spas and Wild Wadi will be  registered towards a Member&rsquo;s <em>isme by  Jumeirah</em> spend. In order for Jumeirah Sirius members to collect Points on  stays, a valid Jumeirah Sirius membership card has to be presented at time of  check-in. </p>
<h4>4.  All Rewards â Generic Rules of Use</h4>

The two items must be from the same category and one must be of  equal or lesser value, e.g. buy one get one free drink; or buy one get one free  main course at lunch.</li>
    <li><em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Rewards may only be used and  redeemed by authorised <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Members.</li>
    <li>In order to qualify for a Spend Reward, the Member  must have sufficient <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Spend registered in his/her account to redeem the Reward.</li>
    <li>Once Rewards are redeemed or expired, they cannot be  cancelled, re-credited, changed or reinstated.</li>

    <li>Member will be required to provide proof of his/her  valid <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> membership  when redeeming any Reward.</li>

    <li><em>isme by Jumeirah</em> Rewards can only be used in  participating Jumeirah venues including dining outlets, spas, Wild Wadi  Waterpark, beach and pool facilities, which are specified on each of the  Rewards&rsquo; terms and conditions. It is the full responsibility of the Member to  check the participating outlets before using any Reward.</li>
    <li>Certain outlets may be closed over summer, Ramadan and  other selected religious holidays or for renovation or other reasons. Jumeirah  cannot be held responsible if an outlet is temporarily or permanently closed  during a Reward&rsquo;s validity period. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Membership Term and Renewal</strong></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>An isme Elite Membership term is twelve (12) months  and an isme Membership term is indefinite, i.e. it does not expire and does not  require renewal.</li>
    <li>isme Elite Membership will be reviewed one year after  the date of qualifying for that Tier category for the purposes of assessing  Membership Renewal.</li>
    <li>Non-Elite<em> isme  by Jumeirah</em> memberships remain valid as long as Members are active in the  programme, and as long as memberships can be validated via the mobile App.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Tier Upgrades, Renewals and Downgrades</strong></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>There are two ways in which Members can qualify for  the isme Elite Tier: <br />
      by reaching a minimum of AED 50,000 registered spend within one membership year  at isme standard tier level, or by paying the annual Elite membership fee of  AED 4,900.</li>
    <li>Elite memberships upgraded through spend-based upgrade  will include the Elite benefits but they will not the Elite Welcome Rewards.  Paid Elite memberships will include all of the benefits and the complimentary  Elite Welcome Rewards.</li>
    <li>Once Members are upgraded to isme Elite, their  registered <em>isme by Jumeirah</em> spend  will go back down to &lsquo;0&rsquo; and start again for the new membership year.</li>
    <li>For isme Members, even if their membership does not  expire, registered spend will also be reset after a year from the date of  enrolment.</li>
    <li>For isme Elite Renewal, a Member&rsquo;s account will be  assessed depending on the amount of registered annual Spend accumulated: </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>- If the required spend is not reached within the isme  Elite membership term, Members will be downgraded to isme. In case of a  downgrade, Members will still be able to retain isme Elite status by paying AED  4,900.<br />
  - If Members have reached the required amount of  registered spend within the isme Elite membership term, Members will retain  their Elite status and benefits for one further membership year but will not  receive the Elite Welcome Rewards. However, they will be given the option to  purchase the AED 4,900 isme Elite membership for another year to obtain the  isme Elite Welcome Rewards.<br />
  <br />
